# vcast (v1.14)

This application provides display and control of Android devices connected on
USB (or [over TCP/IP][article-tcpip]). It does not require any _root_ access.
It works on _GNU/Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.

![screenshot](assets/screenshot-debian-600.jpg)

It focuses on:

 - **lightness** (native, displays only the device screen)
 - **performance** (30~60fps)
 - **quality** (1920×1080 or above)
 - **low latency** ([35~70ms][lowlatency])
 - **low startup time** (~1 second to display the first image)
 - **non-intrusiveness** (nothing is left installed on the device)

[lowlatency]: https://github.com/KristiaN1337/vcast/pull/646


## Requirements

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling

On some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option][control] to
control it using keyboard and mouse.

```bash
brew cask install android-platform-tools
```

You can also [build the app manually][BUILD].


## Run

Plug an Android device, and execute:

```bash
vcast
```

It accepts command-line arguments, listed by:

```bash
vcast --help
```

## Features

### Capture configuration

#### Reduce size

Sometimes, it is useful to mirror an Android device at a lower definition to
increase performance.

To limit both the width and height to some value (e.g. 1024):

```bash
vcast --max-size 1024
vcast -m 1024  # short version
```

The other dimension is computed to that the device aspect ratio is preserved.
That way, a device in 1920×1080 will be mirrored at 1024×576.


#### Change bit-rate

The default bit-rate is 8 Mbps. To change the video bitrate (e.g. to 2 Mbps):

```bash
vcast --bit-rate 2M
vcast -b 2M  # short version
```

#### Limit frame rate

The capture frame rate can be limited:

```bash
vcast --max-fps 15
```

This is officially supported since Android 10, but may work on earlier versions.

#### Crop

The device screen may be cropped to mirror only part of the screen.

This is useful for example to mirror only one eye of the Oculus Go:

```bash
vcast --crop 1224:1440:0:0   # 1224x1440 at offset (0,0)
```

If `--max-size` is also specified, resizing is applied after cropping.


#### Lock video orientation


To lock the orientation of the mirroring:

```bash
vcast --lock-video-orientation 0   # natural orientation
vcast --lock-video-orientation 1   # 90° counterclockwise
vcast --lock-video-orientation 2   # 180°
vcast --lock-video-orientation 3   # 90° clockwise
```

This affects recording orientation.


### Recording

It is possible to record the screen while mirroring:

```bash
vcast --record file.mp4
vcast -r file.mkv
```

To disable mirroring while recording:

```bash
vcast --no-display --record file.mp4
vcast -Nr file.mkv
# interrupt recording with Ctrl+C
```

"Skipped frames" are recorded, even if they are not displayed in real time (for
performance reasons). Frames are _timestamped_ on the device, so [packet delay
variation] does not impact the recorded file.

[packet delay variation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation


### Connection

#### Wireless

_vcast_ uses `adb` to communicate with the device, and `adb` can [connect] to a
device over TCP/IP:

1. Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi as your computer.
2. Get your device IP address (in Settings → About phone → Status).
3. Enable adb over TCP/IP on your device: `adb tcpip 5555`.
4. Unplug your device.
5. Connect to your device: `adb connect DEVICE_IP:5555` _(replace `DEVICE_IP`)_.
6. Run `vcast` as usual.

It may be useful to decrease the bit-rate and the definition:

```bash
vcast --bit-rate 2M --max-size 800
vcast -b2M -m800  # short version
```

[connect]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#wireless


#### Multi-devices

If several devices are listed in `adb devices`, you must specify the _serial_:

```bash
vcast --serial 0123456789abcdef
vcast -s 0123456789abcdef  # short version
```

If the device is connected over TCP/IP:

```bash
vcast --serial 192.168.0.1:5555
vcast -s 192.168.0.1:5555  # short version
```

You can start several instances of _vcast_ for several devices.

#### Autostart on device connection

You could use [AutoAdb]:

```bash
autoadb vcast -s '{}'
```

[AutoAdb]: https://github.com/rom1v/autoadb

#### SSH tunnel

To connect to a remote device, it is possible to connect a local `adb` client to
a remote `adb` server (provided they use the same version of the _adb_
protocol):

```bash
adb kill-server    # kill the local adb server on 5037
ssh -CN -L5037:localhost:5037 -R27183:localhost:27183 your_remote_computer
# keep this open
```

From another terminal:

```bash
vcast
```

To avoid enabling remote port forwarding, you could force a forward connection
instead (notice the `-L` instead of `-R`):

```bash
adb kill-server    # kill the local adb server on 5037
ssh -CN -L5037:localhost:5037 -L27183:localhost:27183 your_remote_computer
# keep this open
```

From another terminal:

```bash
vcast --force-adb-forward
```


Like for wireless connections, it may be useful to reduce quality:

```
vcast -b2M -m800 --max-fps 15
```

### Window configuration

#### Title

By default, the window title is the device model. It can be changed:

```bash
vcast --window-title 'My device'
```

#### Position and size

The initial window position and size may be specified:

```bash
vcast --window-x 100 --window-y 100 --window-width 800 --window-height 600
```

#### Borderless

To disable window decorations:

```bash
vcast --window-borderless
```

#### Always on top

To keep the vcast window always on top:

```bash
vcast --always-on-top
```

#### Fullscreen

The app may be started directly in fullscreen:

```bash
vcast --fullscreen
vcast -f  # short version
```

Fullscreen can then be toggled dynamically with `Ctrl`+`f`.

#### Rotation

The window may be rotated:

```bash
vcast --rotation 1
```

Possibles values are:
 - `0`: no rotation
 - `1`: 90 degrees counterclockwise
 - `2`: 180 degrees
 - `3`: 90 degrees clockwise

The rotation can also be changed dynamically with `Ctrl`+`←` _(left)_ and
`Ctrl`+`→` _(right)_.

Note that _vcast_ manages 3 different rotations:
 - `Ctrl`+`r` requests the device to switch between portrait and landscape (the
   current running app may refuse, if it does support the requested
   orientation).
 - `--lock-video-orientation` changes the mirroring orientation (the orientation
   of the video sent from the device to the computer). This affects the
   recording.
 - `--rotation` (or `Ctrl`+`←`/`Ctrl`+`→`) rotates only the window content. This
   affects only the display, not the recording.


### Other mirroring options

#### Read-only

To disable controls (everything which can interact with the device: input keys,
mouse events, drag&drop files):

```bash
vcast --no-control
vcast -n
```

#### Display

If several displays are available, it is possible to select the display to
mirror:

```bash
vcast --display 1
```

The list of display ids can be retrieved by:

```
adb shell dumpsys display   # search "mDisplayId=" in the output
```

The secondary display may only be controlled if the device runs at least Android
10 (otherwise it is mirrored in read-only).


#### Stay awake

To prevent the device to sleep after some delay when the device is plugged in:

```bash
vcast --stay-awake
vcast -w
```

The initial state is restored when vcast is closed.


#### Turn screen off

It is possible to turn the device screen off while mirroring on start with a
command-line option:

```bash
vcast --turn-screen-off
vcast -S
```

Or by pressing `Ctrl`+`o` at any time.

To turn it back on, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`o` (or `POWER`, `Ctrl`+`p`).

It can also be useful to prevent the device from sleeping:

```bash
vcast --turn-screen-off --stay-awake
vcast -Sw
```


#### Render expired frames

By default, to minimize latency, _vcast_ always renders the last decoded frame
available, and drops any previous one.

To force the rendering of all frames (at a cost of a possible increased
latency), use:

```bash
vcast --render-expired-frames
```

#### Show touches

For presentations, it may be useful to show physical touches (on the physical
device).

Android provides this feature in _Developers options_.

_vcast_ provides an option to enable this feature on start and restore the
initial value on exit:

```bash
vcast --show-touches
vcast -t
```

Note that it only shows _physical_ touches (with the finger on the device).


### Input control

#### Rotate device screen

Press `Ctrl`+`r` to switch between portrait and landscape modes.

Note that it rotates only if the application in foreground supports the
requested orientation.

#### Copy-paste

It is possible to synchronize clipboards between the computer and the device, in
both directions:

 - `Ctrl`+`c` copies the device clipboard to the computer clipboard;
 - `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` copies the computer clipboard to the device clipboard (and
   pastes if the device runs Android >= 7);
 - `Ctrl`+`v` _pastes_ the computer clipboard as a sequence of text events (but
   breaks non-ASCII characters).

Moreover, any time the Android clipboard changes, it is automatically
synchronized to the computer clipboard.

#### Text injection preference

There are two kinds of [events][textevents] generated when typing text:
 - _key events_, signaling that a key is pressed or released;
 - _text events_, signaling that a text has been entered.

By default, letters are injected using key events, so that the keyboard behaves
as expected in games (typically for WASD keys).

But this may [cause issues][prefertext]. If you encounter such a problem, you
can avoid it by:

```bash
vcast --prefer-text
```

(but this will break keyboard behavior in games)

### File drop

#### Install APK

To install an APK, drag & drop an APK file (ending with `.apk`) to the _vcast_
window.

There is no visual feedback, a log is printed to the console.


#### Push file to device

To push a file to `/sdcard/` on the device, drag & drop a (non-APK) file to the
_vcast_ window.

There is no visual feedback, a log is printed to the console.

The target directory can be changed on start:

```bash
vcast --push-target /sdcard/foo/bar/
```


### Audio forwarding

Audio is not forwarded by _vcast_. Use [sndcpy].

## Custom paths

To use a specific _adb_ binary, configure its path in the environment variable
`ADB`:

    ADB=/path/to/adb vcast

To override the path of the `vcast-server` file, configure its path in
`vcast_SERVER_PATH`.

## Why _vcast_?

A colleague challenged me to find a name as unpronounceable as [gnirehtet].

[`strcpy`] copies a **str**ing; `vcast` copies a **scr**een.
